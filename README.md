# Hi there ðŸ‘‹

### My name's Kelner, and I'm a fullstack developer from Brazil :brazil:

I've been studying web development since 2021, when I had my first contact with this world. Therefore, I'm kinda rookie, but still, I've learned so much since then.

- ðŸŒ± Now I'm learning Python, and trying to improve my logical thinking skills.

Well, I'm currently unemployed, which means that you can hire me anytime haha :satisfied:.
