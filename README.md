# Hi there 👋

### My name's Kelner, and I'm a fullstack developer from Brazil :brazil:

I've been studying web development since 2021, when I had my first contact with this world. Therefore, I'm kinda rookie, but still, I've learned so much since then.

- 🌱 Now I’m learning backend development with TypeScript, Node.JS and Express.

Well, I'm currently unemployed, which means that you can hire me anytime haha :satisfied:.

- 📫 How to reach me: You can contact me through email kelner250@hotmail.com or social medias below.
